Mayer’s ‘Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning’. The STS is a highly structured academic system. Through the use of a 9-stage lesson organizational structure, STS is used in every SchoolPage session ensuring better engagement, superior retention and rapid results. STS includes the use of cognitive tools such as Mind Mapping, self-diagnosis tools such as Comfort Boxes, and Learning Outcomes that are highly student centric."
